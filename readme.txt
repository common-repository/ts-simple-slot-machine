Use a shortcode to display a nice slot machine with food items.

== Description ==
TS Slot Machine is a Wordpress plugin that displays a slot machine on your website. You can place it wherever you want using the shortcode `[slot-machine]` which displays the slot machine. 

The slot machine has different food items and the main purpose for the plugin is to create a fun way to choose what to eat or just play with the machine. 

This plugin is ideal for food related sites but is of course suitable for other more casual blog sites. 

Get at least two in a row to help you decide what you're going to eat on your next meal!

= Modern look out of the box =
The slot machine comes in with very modern style out of the box. It uses the default fonts from your theme to achieve the same consistent look with the rest of your website. With additional CSS you can of course re-style the plugin to suit your needs. View the screenshot to display the base style of the slot machine.
